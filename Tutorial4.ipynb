    "Today we discover a new family of problems, called scheduling. Scheduling problems are widely present in real life applications such as timetabelling, transportation, project management, and manufacturing. We consider a particular problem called the job shop scheduling problem.  In this problem, we are given a set of $n$ jobs: $J_1, J_2, \\ldots,  J_n$ and a set of $m$ machines $M_1, M_2, \\ldots,  M_m$. \n",
    "Each job $J_i$ is defined by a set of $m$ (non-preemptive) tasks $T_{i,1} \\ldots T_{i,m}$. Every task $T_{i,k}$ is associated with a duration $p_{i,k}$ and is supposed to be scheduled on machine $M_k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem has two sets of constraints: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Precedence constraints: Each job is associated with an order of tasks to respect when scheduling the different tasks.\n",
    " - Disjunctive constraints: Each machine can process only one task at a given time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard optimisation version of this problem asks to minimize the makespan, i.e., the total scheduling time.\n"
